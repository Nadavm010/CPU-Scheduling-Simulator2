 Features
- Add multiple processes with:
  - Process ID
  - Arrival Time
  - Burst Time
  - Priority
- Support for:
  - SJF (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)
- Gantt Chart visualization for both algorithms
- Performance metrics:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Response Time
- Automatic comparison between algorithms
- Final conclusion analysis
- Validation for incorrect inputs
- Predefined test scenarios

 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. SJF (Shortest Job First)
- Selects process with shortest burst time
- Two versions:
  - Non-Preemptive
  - Preemptive (SRTF)

### 2. Priority Scheduling
- Selects process with highest priority (lowest number = highest priority)
- Two versions:
  - Non-Preemptive
  - Preemptive

---

 Output Features

- Gantt Chart visualization for each algorithm
- Metrics table showing:
  - Completion Time
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Response Time
- Comparison Table between SJF and Priority
- Final recommendation based on performance

Example:
| PID | Arrival | Burst | Priority |
|-----|--------|-------|----------|
| 1   | 0      | 5     | 2        |
| 2   | 1      | 3     | 1        |
| 3   | 2      | 4     | 3        |

 Notes
- The simulator assumes all inputs are valid integers after validation.
- Lower priority number means higher priority.
- CPU idle time is handled in both algorithms.

 Future Improvements
- Add Round Robin algorithm
- Export results to Excel/PDF
- Dark mode UI
- Animated Gantt chart
